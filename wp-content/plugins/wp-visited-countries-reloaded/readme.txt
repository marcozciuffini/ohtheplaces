This plugin uses [amMap](http://www.ammap.com/) for displaying a map with JavaScript.

Use the following shortcode to embed the map in your post:

`[wp-visited-countries width="600" height="300"]I've visited {num} out of {total} countries. That is {percent}.[/wp-visited-countries]`


== Installation ==

1. Install automatically through the `Plugins` > `Add New` menu in WordPress, or upload the entire `wp-visited-countries-reloaded` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress. A `Visited Countries` menu will then appear in your WordPress admin panel. Click on the menu to configure the settings and add new country
3. Use the following shortcode to embed the map in your post:
